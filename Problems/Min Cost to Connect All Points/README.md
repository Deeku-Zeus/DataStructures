**Explanation:** 
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/26/c.png)
We can connect the points as shown above to get the minimum cost of 20.
Notice that there is a unique path between every pair of points.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** points = [[3,12],[-2,5],[-4,1]]
**Output:** 18

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= points.length <= 1000`
- `-106 <= xi, yi <= 106`
- All pairs `(xi, yi)` are distinct.
